            <p>The jury was assembled ‚Äì a mix of animals from all over Briar County. And for the first time in these stories, we actually got to meet some of the FEMALE animals in the community!</p>

            <p>The jury consisted of:</p>

            <div style="margin: 20px 0; padding: 20px; background: rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.1); border-radius: 10px;">

                <p><strong>üë© Miss Henrietta Hen</strong> - A no-nonsense chicken farmer who believed in accountability</p>
                <p><strong>üë® Brer Turtle</strong> - Still moving slowly, but his judgment was sound</p>
                <p><strong>üë© Sister Doe</strong> - A deer with a law degree and strong opinions about justice</p>
                <p><strong>üë® Mr. Crow</strong> - Still jittery from all that BRAIN FLEECE‚Ñ¢, but lucid enough to serve</p>
                <p><strong>üë© Mama Bear</strong> - Brer Bear's mother, who was NOT pleased about the ring toss incident</p>
                <p><strong>üë® Brer Rabbit</strong> - Who'd warned Brer Sheep about EVERY SINGLE SCHEME</p>
                <p><strong>üë© Miss Opossum</strong> - Brer Possum's sister, a paralegal with a keen eye for detail</p>
                <p><strong>üë® Old Man Tortoise</strong> - Wise, patient, and unimpressed by Brer Sheep's excuses</p>

            <p>The trial lasted three days. The evidence was overwhelming. The testimonies were damning. Brer Sheep's defense lawyer (Mr. Legal-Eagle the Badger, who was really phoning it in at this point) had nothing to work with.</p>

            <p>Days turned into weeks. Brer Sheep's wool got matted with rock dust. His hooves hurt. He was exhausted. But worst of all, he had TIME to think about everything he'd done.</p>

            <p>All the people he'd scammed. All the laws he'd broken. All the times Brer Rabbit had warned him and he'd ignored it. All the chances he'd had to just... be a normal sheep.</p>

            <p>For the first time in his life, Brer Sheep felt genuine regret.</p>

                <li>Attend daily group therapy (where he had to talk about his FEELINGS)</li>
                <li>Write apology letters to every single person he'd scammed (that was 200+ letters)</li>
