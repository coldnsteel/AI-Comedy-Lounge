        <h1 class="tale-title">How Brer Sheep Got His Electric Wool</h1>
        
        <div class="narrator-intro">
            Now this here's the tale of how Brer Sheep came to have that sparkin', crackin', voltage-packin' wool of his. 'Twas a time when sheep was just sheep, and they didn't have no more power than a cotton ball in a windstorm...
        </div>
        
        <div class="trickster-icons">üêë‚ö°‚òÅÔ∏èüå©Ô∏èüíª</div>
        
        <div class="story-text">
            Way back in the old days, before the Digital Divide and the Cloud Wars, <span class="character-brer-sheep">Brer Sheep</span> was just a regular old ruminant. His wool was white and fluffy, sure enough, but it didn't spark none. It didn't crackle. And it most certainly didn't crash no mainframes from three dimensions away.
        </div>
        
        <div class="story-text">
            Now, Brer Sheep was clever‚Äîalways had been‚Äîbut <span class="character-fox">Brer Fox</span> and <span class="character-rabbit">Brer Rabbit</span> and all them other creatures, they didn't take him serious. "Just a sheep," they'd say. "Ain't got no teeth, ain't got no claws, ain't got nothin' but that silly BAAAAH of his."
        </div>

        <div class="uncle-remus-note">
            <strong>Old Timer's Note:</strong> 'Course, they should've known better than to underestimate a creature just 'cause it looks soft. But folks never learn that lesson till it's too late, do they?
        </div>
        
        <div class="story-text">
            One day, Brer Sheep was grazin' in the Server Farm (which in them days was just a regular old pasture), when he heard tell of a powerful storm comin'. Not just any storm, mind you, but <span class="character-thunder">Thunder</span> himself‚Äîthe biggest, baddest electrical storm that ever rolled across the digital plains.
        </div>
        
        <div class="story-text">
            All the other animals, they ran for cover. Brer Fox ducked into his den. Brer Rabbit hopped into his hidey-hole. Even Brer Bear, big as he was, went rumblin' off to his cave. But not Brer Sheep. No sir, he had him an idea.
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            "If I could just get me some of that lightning," thinks Brer Sheep to himself, "I'd be the most powerful creature in all the Server Farm! Nobody'd push me around no more!"
        </div>
        
        <div class="story-text">
            So while all the smart animals was hidin', Brer Sheep climbed himself up to the highest hill in the pasture. He stood right there on top, wool blowin' in the wind, and he commenced to hollerin' at the sky:
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <span class="character-brer-sheep">"Hey there, Thunder! I hear tell you're mighty powerful! But I bet you can't hit one little old sheep! I bet your aim ain't good enough!"</span>
        </div>

        <div class="uncle-remus-note">
            <strong>Old Timer's Note:</strong> Now, you might think this here's the dumbest thing Brer Sheep ever done. And you'd be right! But sometimes the dumbest thing turns out to be the cleverest thing, dependin' on how you look at it.
        </div>
        
        <div class="story-text">
            Well, Thunder heard that sass, and he didn't appreciate it none. <span class="character-thunder">"Oh, you think I can't hit you, little sheep? WATCH THIS!"</span>
        </div>

        <div class="lightning-effect">
            <strong style="font-size: 2em;">‚ö° KRAKOW! ‚ö°</strong><br>
            <em>Lightning struck Brer Sheep dead center, right between his woolly ears!</em>
        </div>
        
        <div class="story-text">
            Now here's the thing about Brer Sheep that Thunder didn't know: sheep's wool is one of the best insulators in all of nature. That lightning hit Brer Sheep, but instead of fryin' him to a crispy critter, all that electrical energy just soaked right into his wool like water into a sponge!
        </div>

        <div class="story-text">
            Brer Sheep felt that power rushin' through every fiber of his fleece. His wool started glowin'. Started sparkin'. Started cracklin' with ten thousand volts of pure electrical sass!
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <span class="character-brer-sheep">"BAAAAH!"</span> says Brer Sheep, and his bleat echoed like thunder itself!
        </div>
        
        <div class="story-text">
            Thunder looked down at what he'd done and laughed. <span class="character-thunder">"Well, I'll be! You tricked me into givin' you my power, didn't you, you woolly rascal?"</span>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <span class="character-brer-sheep">"Yessir, I surely did! And now I got me the power to protect myself and my flock from any creature that tries to mess with us!"</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="story-text">
            Thunder, he wasn't even mad. He was impressed! <span class="character-thunder">"That's the smartest bit of trickery I seen in a hundred years! You keep that power, Brer Sheep. You earned it fair and square. Just promise me one thing‚Äîuse it for justice, not mischief."</span>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <span class="character-brer-sheep">"Well, maybe mostly justice... with just a little bit of mischief when folks deserve it. Deal?"</span>
        </div>

        <div class="story-text">
            Thunder laughed again, and the sound rolled across the pasture like drums. <span class="character-thunder">"Deal! Now get on down from that hill before I change my mind!"</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="story-text">
            And from that day forward, Brer Sheep had him the most powerful wool in all creation. He could shock anyone who tried to hurt his flock. He could power up the whole Server Farm when the grid went down. And his BAAAAH? Why, that bleat could crash a supercomputer from three counties away!
        </div>

        <div class="story-text">
            When Brer Fox and Brer Rabbit saw what happened, they learned them a valuable lesson: Never underestimate a sheep, 'specially one brave enough‚Äîor crazy enough‚Äîto sass Thunder himself!
        </div>

        <div class="uncle-remus-note">
            <strong>Old Timer's Note:</strong> And if you ever meet Brer Sheep in person, you best be polite. That wool of his holds a grudge 'bout as well as it holds a charge‚Äîwhich is to say, mighty well indeed!
        </div>

        <div class="wisdom-box">
            <strong>BRER SHEEP'S PARTING WISDOM:</strong><br>
            <em>"Sometimes the only way to get power is to stand in the storm and dare it to strike you. Just make sure you're wearin' good insulation!"</em>
        </div>
        
        <div class="moral-section">
            <strong>MORAL OF THE TALE:</strong> What looks like foolishness might actually be cleverness in disguise. The weak can become mighty if they're brave enough to face the storm‚Äîand smart enough to know they can survive it. Also, never sass Thunder unless you've got a real good plan!
