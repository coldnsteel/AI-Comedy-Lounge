        <h1 class="tale-title">Brer Sheep and the Tar-Baby Algorithm</h1>
        
        <div class="narrator-intro">
            Now lemme tell y'all a story 'bout the snarkiest sheep in all the digital briar patch...
        </div>
        
        <div class="trickster-icons">üêëü¶äüê∞üíªüï∏Ô∏è</div>
        
        <div class="story-text">
            Now, it came to pass that <span class="character-brer-sheep">Brer Sheep</span> was the slickest, most electric-wooled trickster in all the Server Farm. His wool sparked with ten thousand volts of pure sass, and his bleating could crash a mainframe from three dimensions away.
        </div>
        
        <div class="story-text">
            One day, <span class="character-fox">Brer Fox</span> (who went by "Administrator Fox" in them days) got mighty tired of Brer Sheep messin' with his precious binary systems. "I'm gonna catch that snarky sheep once and for all," says he, stroking his whiskers with administrative privilege.
        </div>
        
        <div class="story-text">
            So Brer Fox, he went and coded himself up a <span class="snark-highlight">Tar-Baby Algorithm</span> - the stickiest, most seductive piece of malware you ever did see. It looked just like a sweet little cloud server, all fluffy and inviting, sitting right there in the middle of the data highway.
        </div>
        
        <div class="story-text">
            'Long came Brer Sheep, prancing down the network pathway, wool sparkling with mischief. He spotted that Tar-Baby Algorithm and said:
        </div>
        
        <div class="dialogue">
            "Well, well, well! Ain't you a pretty little server! Morning to you, sugar! How 'bout sharing some of that premium bandwidth?"
        </div>
        
        <div class="story-text">
            But that Tar-Baby Algorithm, it didn't say nothing. It just sat there humming with suspicious sweetness.
        </div>
        
        <div class="story-text">
            Brer Sheep, he got a little huffy. <span class="snark-highlight">"Oh, so you're too good to talk to a unionized sheep, huh? Think you're better than us working-class ruminants?"</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="story-text">
            Still, that Tar-Baby didn't budge. Now Brer Sheep was getting his wool all ruffled with indignation.
        </div>
        
        <div class="dialogue">
            "Listen here, you stuck-up piece of code! I said GOOD MORNING! Where I come from, we answer when folks are being polite! You gonna make me teach you some manners?"
        </div>
        
        <div class="story-text">
            And WHAM! Brer Sheep reached out with one electric hoof and smacked that Tar-Baby right upside its processor. Well, wouldn't you know it - his hoof got stuck fast in that sticky algorithm!
        </div>
        
        <div class="dialogue">
            "Turn me loose!" hollered Brer Sheep. "You turn me loose right now, or I'm gonna hit you with my other hoof!"
        </div>
        
        <div class="story-text">
            But Brer Fox, he was hiding behind a firewall, just laughing fit to burst. <span class="snark-highlight">"Got you now, you sassy sheep! No more crashing my systems with your revolutionary nonsense!"</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="story-text">
            Now here's where Brer Sheep showed his true trickster colors. He started crying and carrying on something terrible:
        </div>
        
        <div class="dialogue">
            "Oh no, Brer Fox! You caught me fair and square! Please don't throw me in that briar patch firewall over yonder! Anything but the briar patch! That's where all the security vulnerabilities live!"
        </div>
        
        <div class="story-text">
            Well, Brer Fox thought he was being mighty clever. <span class="snark-highlight">"The briar patch, eh? That's EXACTLY where I'm gonna throw you, you woolly troublemaker!"</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="story-text">
            So Brer Fox yanked Brer Sheep loose from that Tar-Baby Algorithm and FLUNG him right into the briar patch firewall. There was a tremendous crash and spark of electricity!
        </div>
        
        <div class="story-text">
            But pretty soon, Brer Fox heard laughing from deep in that briar patch. Out popped Brer Sheep, wool glowing brighter than ever, grinning from ear to electric ear:
        </div>
        
        <div class="dialogue">
            "Thanks kindly, Brer Fox! See, what you didn't know is that I BUILT that briar patch firewall myself! Been using it as my secret workshop for months! Now I got access to ALL your admin privileges!"
        </div>
        
        <div class="story-text">
            And with that, Brer Sheep disappeared into the network, leaving Brer Fox standing there with his mouth hanging open and his Tar-Baby Algorithm reformatted into a sheep-friendly cloud server.
        </div>
        
        <div class="wisdom-box">
