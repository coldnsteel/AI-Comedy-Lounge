            <p>Now gather 'round, friends, and let me tell you about the time Brer Sheep got into the wellness industry. And by "wellness industry," I mean selling questionable supplements out of his barn to anyone gullible enough to believe that dried grass clippings could cure arthritis.</p>

            <p>It all started when Brer Sheep was watching late-night TV and saw one of them infomercials for miracle pills that promised to make you younger, smarter, stronger, and more attractive ‚Äì basically everything you ain't.</p>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <span class="character">Brer Sheep</span> (watching TV at 3 AM): "This is BRILLIANT! They're selling hope in a bottle!"<br><br>

                <span class="character">Brer Sheep</span>: "I got herbs! I got a full moon! I don't got monks, but I got... uh... enthusiasm!"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Brer Rabbit</span> (walking past): "Why are you up at 3 AM watching supplement commercials?"<br><br>

                <span class="character">Brer Rabbit</span>: "You ain't got no pharmaceutical license."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Brer Sheep</span> (waving hand dismissively): "Details! We'll call it 'herbal supplements' ‚Äì that way we don't need FDA approval!"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Brer Rabbit</span>: "That sounds illegal."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Brer Sheep</span>: "Illegal is such a strong word. I prefer 'creatively compliant.'"
            </div>

            <p>The next morning, Brer Sheep was up at dawn, converting his barn into what he called "The Wellness Barn" ‚Äì a holistic healing center that was about as holistic as a gas station hot dog.</p>

            <p>They put up signs all over Briar County with quotes from totally real people who definitely existed:</p>

            <p>The marketing worked. Within days, animals from all over were lining up at The Wellness Barn, desperate to buy miracle cures for problems they didn't even have.</p>

            <div class="chapter-title">ü§ë CHAPTER THREE: Business is Booming</div>

            <p>The Wellness Barn became the hottest spot in Briar County. Brer Sheep couldn't bottle his questionable concoctions fast enough. He had Brer Fox mixing potions in the back, Brer Possum labeling bottles (mostly upside down, but nobody noticed), and Brer Turtle doing quality control (he fell asleep, so there wasn't any).</p>

            <div class="dialogue">

                <span class="character">Brer Sheep</span> (quickly): "I SAID IT WORKS GREAT BYE THANK YOU FOR YOUR MONEY!"
            </div>

            <p>Brer Wolf came in with back pain. Brer Sheep sold him DETOX DELUXE‚Ñ¢. When Brer Wolf pointed out that detox doesn't treat back pain, Brer Sheep explained that the back pain was probably caused by "toxins" and therefore detox was the answer. Brer Wolf bought six bottles.</p>

            <p>Brer Crow flew in complaining about not being able to sleep. Brer Sheep sold him BRAIN FLEECE‚Ñ¢ (which was loaded with caffeine). When Brer Crow came back three days later looking like he hadn't slept in a week, Brer Sheep sold him MORE BRAIN FLEECE‚Ñ¢, explaining that he just needed a "higher dose."</p>

            <div class="action">*Cha-ching! Cha-ching! Cha-ching!*</div>

            <p>Money was rolling in faster than Brer Sheep could count it. He bought himself a new tractor, a fancy hat, and seventeen gaming consoles (he learned nothing from the tax evasion incident).</p>

            <div class="chapter-title">‚ö†Ô∏è CHAPTER FOUR: The Side Effects</div>

            <p>About two weeks into the business, things started going sideways. Turns out when you sell people bottles of random stuff mixed in your barn, sometimes there are... consequences.</p>

            <p>Brer Bear, who'd been taking WOOL POWER‚Ñ¢ religiously, showed up at the barn looking distressed.</p>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <span class="character">Brer Bear</span>: "Brer Sheep! Something's wrong!"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Brer Sheep</span>: "What is it?"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Brer Bear</span>: "I'm growing WOOL! Look!"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Brer Sheep</span> (staring): "...that's just fur."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Brer Bear</span>: "NO! It's WOOL! Your product turned me into a sheep-bear hybrid!"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Brer Sheep</span>: "Brer Bear, you're a bear. You have fur. You've always had fur."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Brer Bear</span>: "But it's FLUFFIER now! That's not normal!"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Brer Sheep</span>: "That's called... winter coat. It happens every year."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Brer Bear</span>: "...oh."
            </div>

            <p>Then Brer Crow came in, and he was a different story entirely.</p>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <span class="character">Brer Crow</span> (vibrating): "I-CAN'T-STOP-TALKING-AND-I-HAVEN'T-SLEPT-IN-FOUR-DAYS-AND-I-CAN-SEE-SOUNDS-AND-HEAR-COLORS-AND‚Äî"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Brer Sheep</span>: "Ah. Yeah. That's the caffeine. You might wanna cut back on the BRAIN FLEECE‚Ñ¢."<br><br>

            </div>

            <p>But the worst was Brer Possum. He'd been "testing" the ETERNAL YOUTH ELIXIR‚Ñ¢ (which was mostly apple cider vinegar and glitter) and was now convinced he was Benjamin Button.</p>

            <div class="dialogue">

            <div class="chapter-title">üö® CHAPTER FIVE: The Authorities</div>

            <p>Word of The Wellness Barn's "miracle cures" eventually reached the wrong ears ‚Äì specifically, the ears of Health Inspector Badger, who was ALSO a cousin of IRS Agent Badger. (The Badgers were a very law-enforcement-oriented family.)</p>

            <p>Inspector Badger showed up at The Wellness Barn with a clipboard, a serious expression, and a profound lack of patience for Brer Sheep's nonsense.</p>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <span class="character">Inspector Badger</span>: "I'm here to inspect this... 'wellness center.'"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Brer Sheep</span> (nervously): "Everything's above board! All natural! Completely legitimate!"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Inspector Badger</span> (picking up a bottle): "What's in this?"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Brer Sheep</span>: "Herbs!"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Inspector Badger</span> (reading label): "It says 'proprietary blend.'"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Brer Sheep</span>: "Proprietary herbs!"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Inspector Badger</span>: "This is grass clippings."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Brer Sheep</span>: "Artisanal grass clippings."
            </div>

            <p>Inspector Badger went through the entire barn, finding violations at every turn. Unsanitary mixing conditions. Unlabeled ingredients. False advertising. Products that claimed to cure diseases without any scientific backing whatsoever. And in the back room, he found Brer Fox literally mixing potions in a bucket with a stick.</p>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <span class="character">Inspector Badger</span>: "Is that... is that a bucket?"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Brer Fox</span>: "It's a PHARMACEUTICAL VESSEL."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Inspector Badger</span>: "It's a BUCKET. From Home Depot. I can still see the price tag."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Brer Fox</span>: "...I can explain."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Inspector Badger</span>: "Don't."
            </div>

            <p>Inspector Badger shut down The Wellness Barn on the spot. Posted a giant "CLOSED BY HEALTH DEPARTMENT" sign on the door. Confiscated all the products. And gave Brer Sheep a citation so long it looked like a CVS receipt.</p>

            <div class="action">*Brer Sheep watches his empire crumble in real-time*</div>

        <div class="chapter" data-narrate="true">
            <div class="chapter-title">üí∏ CHAPTER SIX: The Refunds</div>

            <p>The worst part wasn't the shut-down. The worst part was that Brer Sheep had to give REFUNDS.</p>

            <p>Every single customer who'd bought his questionable supplements came back demanding their money. And since Brer Sheep had already spent most of it on gaming consoles and a fancy hat, he had to get creative.</p>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <span class="character">Brer Bear</span>: "I want my $149.97 back!"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Brer Sheep</span>: "But... didn't you feel stronger?"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Brer Bear</span>: "NO! I felt FLUFFIER! That's not the same thing!"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Brer Sheep</span> (handing over money): "Here's your refund."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Brer Bear</span>: "...is this Monopoly money?"<br><br>

                <span class="character">Brer Bear</span>: "I WANT REAL MONEY!"
            </div>

            <p>Brer Sheep had to sell his fancy hat, return the gaming consoles, and even sell his tractor (again ‚Äì this was becoming a pattern) just to cover all the refunds. By the end of it, he was broker than he'd been before he started the whole operation.</p>

            <p>But wait ‚Äì there was MORE trouble!</p>

            <p>Turns out, selling supplements without FDA approval was a federal offense. And who showed up to deal with federal offenses? That's right ‚Äì Agent Badger from the IRS, who was VERY pleased to see Brer Sheep again.</p>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <span class="character">Agent Badger</span>: "Twice in one year, Mr. Sheep? I'm impressed."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Brer Sheep</span>: "This is different! This was SUPPLEMENTS!"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Agent Badger</span>: "This was FRAUD."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Brer Sheep</span>: "...can I go back to the briar patch?"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Agent Badger</span>: "Absolutely not."

        <div class="chapter" data-narrate="true">
            <div class="chapter-title">‚öñÔ∏è CHAPTER SEVEN: The Settlement</div>

            <p>After some negotiation (and Brer Sheep agreeing to NEVER sell supplements again), they reached a settlement:</p>

            <ul style="color: #f0e6d2; margin: 20px 0; padding-left: 40px;">
                <li>Brer Sheep would pay a fine of $10,000</li>
                <li>Attend a course on "Legal vs. Illegal Business Practices"</li>
                <li>Perform 200 hours of community service at the actual pharmacy in town</li>
                <li>Publicly apologize to everyone he scammed</li>
                <li>Stop watching infomercials at 3 AM</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The public apology was the worst part.</p>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <span class="character">Brer Sheep</span> (standing in town square): "I, Brer Sheep, would like to apologize for selling you all fake miracle cures that were actually just grass, vinegar, and false hope."<br><br>

                <span class="character">Brer Sheep</span>: "I know I promised you'd get stronger, smarter, and younger, but instead you just got poorer and disappointed."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Crowd</span>: "LOUDER BOOING!"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Brer Sheep</span>: "And I'm sorry that Brer Crow hasn't slept in six days and can now see through time."<br><br>

            </div>

            <p>In the end, Brer Sheep learned that maybe, just maybe, watching late-night infomercials and thinking "I could do that!" wasn't always the path to success.</p>
