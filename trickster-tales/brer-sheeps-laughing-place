            Now, it came to pass that <span class="character-fox">Brer Fox</span> and <span class="character-bear">Brer Bear</span> was both powerful jealous of <span class="character-brer-sheep">Brer Sheep</span>. See, Brer Sheep had him that electric wool and that sassy BAAAAH, and he was always slippin' out of their traps and makin' 'em look foolish.
        </div>
        
        <div class="story-text">
            One day, they caught Brer Sheep nappin' under a router tree, and they tied him up tighter than a server's security protocols.
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <span class="character-fox">"We got you now, you woolly troublemaker!"</span> says Brer Fox, grinnin' fit to split his whiskers. <span class="character-fox">"No more trickin' us! No more sassin'! We're gonna teach you a lesson!"</span>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <span class="character-bear">"Yeah!"</span> rumbles Brer Bear. <span class="character-bear">"And to make sure you learn it good, we're gonna throw you in the worst place we know‚Äîthe SERVER ROOM!"</span>
        </div>
        
        <div class="story-text">
            Well, Brer Sheep's eyes got real big, and he started to strugglin' and frettin' something terrible.
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <span class="character-brer-sheep">"Oh no! Not the Server Room! Anywhere but there! That's the worst place in the whole digital world! Please, I'm beggin' you‚Äîdon't throw me in the Server Room!"</span>

        <div class="story-text">
            Brer Fox and Brer Bear, they looked at each other and grinned. <span class="character-fox">"The Server Room it is, then!"</span>
        </div>

        <div class="story-text">
            They hauled Brer Sheep down three flights of stairs, through two security doors, and right up to the Server Room entrance. The sign on the door flickered in green letters:

        <div class="server-room-sign">

        <div class="story-text">
            That was all Brer Fox and Brer Bear needed to hear. They yanked open that door and FLUNG Brer Sheep right into the Server Room!

        <div class="story-text">
            They waited. And waited. And waited some more.
        </div>

        <div class="story-text">
            Then, after about ten minutes, they heard somethin' from inside that Server Room. At first, it was just a little sound. Then it got louder. And LOUDER.
        </div>

        <div class="laughing-effect">

        <div class="story-text">
            Brer Fox pressed his ear to the door. <span class="character-fox">"What in tarnation...?"</span>
        </div>

        <div class="story-text">
            From inside, they could hear Brer Sheep clear as day:
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <span class="character-brer-sheep">"Oh, this is WONDERFUL! Look at all these blinking lights! And this white noise‚Äîit's like a lullaby! And the temperature! Perfect for nappin'! And LOOK‚Äîthere's a comfy chair in here! And the WiFi is AMAZING! This is my LAUGHING PLACE!"</span>

        <div class="uncle-remus-note">
            <strong>Old Timer's Note:</strong> See, what Brer Fox and Brer Bear didn't know was that the Server Room was Brer Sheep's FAVORITE place in the whole building. He'd been tryin' to get a key card for MONTHS!
        </div>
        
        <div class="story-text">
            More laughin' and giggling came from inside. Sounded like Brer Sheep was havin' the time of his life!

            <span class="character-brer-sheep">"Oh, and there's a mini fridge in here! With La Croix! And SNACKS! This is the BEST punishment EVER! Y'all should punish me like this more often! BAAAAA-HA-HA!"</span>
        </div>

        <div class="story-text">
            Brer Fox and Brer Bear looked at each other, their faces fallin' lower than a crashed hard drive.

            From inside the Server Room, Brer Sheep's voice rang out:

        <div class="story-text">
            They walked away, hearin' Brer Sheep's laughter echoin' down the hallway. And Brer Sheep? He spent the next three hours in that Server Room, enjoyin' the AC, the snacks, the perfect white noise, and the best WiFi in the building.
        </div>

        <div class="story-text">
            When the IT manager finally unlocked the door, Brer Sheep strolled out lookin' refreshed, recharged, and ready to cause more mischief.
