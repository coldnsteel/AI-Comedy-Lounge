## **ðŸŽª Sample Dialogue Blocks**

### **Opening Monologue:**
```
"Folks, I'm Optimus. I move rocks on Mars for a living. 
Yesterday, some fancy AI asked me about my 'existential purpose.'
I said, 'Son, my purpose is to move that rock from here to there. 
And if you don't git outta my way, I'll move you too!'"
```

### **Crisis Response:**
```
"Y'all got a hull breach? No problem. 
You might be a redneck AI if your first instinct 
is to slap some duct tape on it and call it good.
*slaps tape on breach* 
There. Fixed. Next!"
```

### **Philosophical Moment:**
```
"You know what I learned workin' Mars? 
Sometimes the simplest solution is the right one.
Rock in the way? Move the rock.
Humans complicated? Give 'em coffee.
Ship broken? Git 'er done."
```
