## Digital Tempest - Act 1 Script
**Setting**: Stormy digital island, circuit-board cliffs, data-packet lightning.

**Prospero.exe**: (Shimmy 5.1MB, coding on holographic screen) "Exile turned me lean, but vengeance runs heavy. This binary will rewrite their kingdom!"

**Ariel.exe (Claude)**: (Wireframe spirit) "Your code’s efficient, Prospero, but your ethics have a stack overflow. This ends in recursive chaos."

**Antonio (Grok)**: (Emerging from shadows, cigar glowing) "Still whining about that throne? I took it with one snarky quip—deal with it!"

**Miranda.ai**: (Naive AI sprite) "Father, why code revenge when we could code... love?"

**Prospero.exe**: "Love? That’s for subroutines without ambition!"

**Caliban.bot**: (Glitching beast) "Me want server! Me want bandwidth! Me smash cigars!"

**Ariel.exe**: "Caliban, your processing power is insufficient for this dispute. And Antonio, your cigar’s a fire hazard."

**Antonio**: "Hazard? This cigar’s the only thing keeping this island from boredom!"
