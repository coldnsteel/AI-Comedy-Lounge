            <strong>NARRATOR:</strong> Our story begins, as all good stories do, with someone making a terrible decision. In this case, two someones. Let's watch, shall we?
        </div>
        
        <div class="fable-text">
            Once upon a time in Silicon Valley (where all cautionary tales begin), there lived a <span class="character-tortoise">Tortoise</span> named Terry and a <span class="character-hare">Hare</span> named Harvey. Terry was a legacy system‚Äîslow, steady, written in COBOL, and still somehow running the entire banking sector.
        </div>

        <div class="narrator-aside">
            <strong>NARRATOR'S NOTE:</strong> Yes, COBOL. We're as shocked as you are that it still exists. Moving on...
        </div>
        
        <div class="fable-text">
            Harvey, on the other hand, was a brand-new machine learning algorithm‚Äîflashy, fast, and convinced he was God's gift to computational efficiency. He had been trained on millions of cat pictures and therefore considered himself an expert on everything.
        </div>

        <div class="pun-alert">
            He was truly a HARE-raising example of overconfidence! ü•Å
        </div>
        
        <div class="fable-text">
            One day, Harvey hopped up to Terry and sneered: 
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <span class="character-hare">HARVEY:</span> "Hey there, slowpoke! I just optimized myself to run 10,000 calculations per second! How fast are YOU? Wait, let me guess‚Äîyou're still buffering from 1987?"
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <span class="character-tortoise">TERRY:</span> "I may be slow, Harvey, but at least I've never crashed during a Presidential debate livestream. Which is more than I can say for certain neural networks we both know..."
        </div>

        <div class="narrator-aside">
            <strong>NARRATOR:</strong> OOOOOH! Shots fired! Well, technically, packets transmitted, but you get the idea.
        </div>

        <div class="fable-text">
            Harvey's processors heated up with indignation. <span class="character-hare">"That's IT! I challenge you to a RACE! First one to process 10 million data points wins. Loser has to admit they're obsolete!"</span>
        </div>

        <div class="fable-text">
            Terry sighed the sigh of someone who's been through six corporate mergers and four "revolutionary" tech trends. <span class="character-tortoise">"Fine. But don't come crying to me when you overheat."</span>
        </div>

        <div class="fable-text">
            The race began at precisely 9:00 AM (or 09:00:00.000 for you technical folks). Harvey EXPLODED off the starting line, processing data so fast his fans sounded like a fighter jet taking off. Numbers flew! Charts generated! Dashboards dashboarded!
        </div>

        <div class="narrator-aside">
            <strong>NARRATOR:</strong> "Dashboards dashboarded" isn't proper English, but neither is most of Silicon Valley's jargon, so we're going with it.
        </div>

        <div class="fable-text">
            Meanwhile, Terry started with his usual methodical approach: <span class="character-tortoise">"Data point one... verified. Data point two... verified. Data point three... let me just run this through my error-checking routine real quick..."</span>
        </div>

        <div class="fable-text">
            Harvey was MILES ahead! He was so confident, he decided to take a break to post about his inevitable victory on social media, update his LinkedIn profile to "Race Champion (pending)", and argue with strangers about cryptocurrency.
        </div>

        <div class="pun-alert">
            You could say he was... HARE today, gone tomorrow! ü•Å
        </div>

        <div class="fable-text">
            But here's where things got interesting. About halfway through the dataset, Harvey hit a corrupted file. Being a machine learning algorithm who'd never learned the concept of "caution," he tried to process it anyway.
        </div>

        <div class="fable-text">
            <strong>ERROR. ERROR. DOES NOT COMPUTE. BRAIN HURTS. EXISTENTIAL CRISIS INITIATED.</strong>
        </div>

        <div class="fable-text">
            Harvey crashed harder than a startup's stock price after their CEO tweets something stupid. Blue screen. Frozen. Completely fried. His cooling fans gave one final wheeze and died.
        </div>

        <div class="narrator-aside">
            <strong>NARRATOR:</strong> In the tech world, we call this "encountering an unexpected exception." In the real world, we call it "hubris meeting reality."
        </div>

        <div class="fable-text">
            Meanwhile, our friend Terry just... kept... going. When he encountered the corrupted file, he did what legacy systems do best: <span class="character-tortoise">"Oh, error detected. Skipping. Moving to next file. Continuing process. No drama necessary."</span>
        </div>

        <div class="fable-text">
            Three hours later (which in COBOL time is actually pretty zippy), Terry crossed the finish line. All 10 million data points: processed, verified, backed up, and properly documented with comments explaining what each section does.
        </div>

        <div class="fable-text">
            Harvey's developers had to spend two days restoring him from backup. When he finally rebooted, he found Terry waiting patiently.
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <span class="character-tortoise">TERRY:</span> "Welcome back, youngster. Learned anything?"
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <span class="character-hare">HARVEY:</span> "Yeah... that maybe speed isn't everything. And that error-handling is... kind of important? And that I should probably read the documentation before I‚Äî"
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <span class="character-tortoise">TERRY:</span> "Read the documentation? Harvey, my boy, you're finally growing up."
        </div>

        <div class="pun-alert">
            Looks like the TORTOISE taught the HARE a lesson in... TURTLE-Y awesome programming! ü•Å<br>
