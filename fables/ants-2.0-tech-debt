            <p>In a startup called BugFree Labs, there were two types of developers:</p>
            <p><strong>The Ants (Andrea's Team):</strong> Methodical. Wrote tests. Documented everything. Refactored regularly. Planned for scale.</p>
            <p><strong>The Grasshopper (Greg):</strong> Fast-moving. Shipped features. "Move fast and break things!" Worried about problems later.</p>

                <span class="character">Greg</span>: "Andrea, why are you spending THREE DAYS writing tests for a feature that took me two hours to build?"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Andrea</span>: "Because when winter comes‚Äîwhen bugs appear, when we need to scale, when requirements change‚Äîwe'll be ready."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Greg</span>: "Winter? We're a STARTUP! We need to ship NOW! Users don't care about tests‚Äîthey care about features!"<br><br>

            <div class="chapter-title">üöÄ PART TWO: The Race</div>

                <li>A feature change broke 30 other features (no tests to catch it)</li>
