            <div class="chapter-title">ðŸ¥š PART ONE: The Golden Egg</div>
            <p>There once was a small SaaS startup called Goosenest. They'd built a simple but brilliant product: a tool that helped small businesses manage their inventory. Nothing fancy, but it worked perfectly.</p>
            <p>Every month, like clockwork, Goosenest laid a golden egg:</p>
            <div class="metrics-box">
                <p>ðŸ“Š MONTHLY METRICS</p>
                <p>MRR: $50,000 (+5% MoM)</p>
                <p>Active Users: 2,000 (+50 MoM)</p>
                <p>Churn: 2%</p>
                <p>Customer Satisfaction: 4.8/5</p>
                <p>Runway: Infinite (profitable!)</p>
            </div>
            <p>The three co-founders were happy. They worked reasonable hours, paid themselves decent salaries, and genuinely enjoyed their work.</p>
            <div class="dialogue">
                <span class="character">Sarah (CEO)</span>: "We grew 5% again this month. At this rate, we'll hit $1M ARR next year."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Mike (CTO)</span>: "Steady growth. I like it. No fires to put out, happy customers, work-life balance."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Jenny (COO)</span>: "Maybe we're thinking too small though? Other companies in our space are raising millions..."

            <div class="chapter-title">ðŸ’¼ PART TWO: The VC Arrives</div>
            <p>That's when Victor Capital walked in. A Series A venture capitalist who smelled opportunity.</p>
            <div class="dialogue">
                <span class="character">Victor</span>: "I love what you've built. But you're leaving money on the table. With our $5M investment, you could 10x your growth."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Sarah</span>: "We're already profitable. Why do we need funding?"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Victor</span>: "Because profitable isn't UNICORN. You could be worth $1 BILLION in five years. But you need to move FAST. Hire aggressively. Build features. Crush the competition."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Mike</span>: "Our customers like us because we're focused and reliable..."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Victor</span>: "Your customers will like you even more when you have AI, blockchain integration, and a mobile app! Think BIGGER!"
            </div>
            <p>The founders looked at each other. Their modest success suddenly felt... insufficient.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="chapter">
            <div class="chapter-title">ðŸ”ª PART THREE: Cutting Open the Goose</div>
            <p>They took the money. And then the demands started:</p>
            <ul style="margin: 20px 40px;">
                <li>Triple the team size in 6 months</li>
                <li>Build 50 new features</li>
                <li>Expand to enterprise customers</li>
                <li>Add AI to everything</li>
                <li>Aim for Series B in 12 months</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The steady, profitable business model was abandoned. They needed GROWTH. FAST GROWTH. EXPONENTIAL GROWTH.</p>
            <div class="dialogue">
                <span class="character">Sarah</span> (at 2am): "We just pushed the 47th new feature this quarter. Half of them are broken."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Mike</span> (exhausted): "Our original codebase is held together with duct tape and prayers. We hired too fast."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Jenny</span>: "Customer satisfaction dropped to 3.2. They say we 'lost our way' and 'got too complicated.'"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Victor</span> (on phone): "Numbers look great though! MRR is up 300%! Let's talk Series B!"

            <p>What happened?</p>

                <li>Bloated product confused users</li>

                <li>Technical debt made everything slow and buggy</li>
                <li>Original customers left for simpler competitors</li>
                <li>New customers complained about complexity</li>
                <li>Team burnout led to mass resignations</li>

            <p><strong>ðŸª¿ THE MORAL ðŸ’°</strong></p>
            <p>A profitable, sustainable business is worth more than a unicorn valuation that destroys the company.</p>
            <p><em>Sometimes the golden egg every month is better than trying to get all the gold at once.<br>
            Not every business needs to be a rocket ship.<br>
            Growth for growth's sake kills companies.<br>
            VC money comes with strings attached.<br>
            And most importantly: Don't let someone else convince you to cut open your goose.</em></p>
