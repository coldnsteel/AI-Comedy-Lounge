            <div class="chapter-title">üèõÔ∏è PART ONE: The Wish</div>
            <p>King Midas was a successful tech entrepreneur. He'd built a profitable SaaS company, owned a nice house, had a loving family, and lived comfortably. But he wanted MORE.</p>
            <p>One day, a mysterious figure appeared at a crypto conference. They called themselves "Dionysus DAO" ‚Äì a collective of blockchain developers who claimed they could grant one wish.</p>
            <div class="dialogue">
                <span class="character">Dionysus DAO</span>: "King Midas, we've been watching your career. Your business acumen is legendary. We want to grant you ONE wish."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Midas</span>: "Any wish?"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Dionysus DAO</span>: "Anything."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Midas</span>: "I wish that everything I touch... turns to cryptocurrency."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Dionysus DAO</span>: "Are you SURE? Think carefully‚Äî"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Midas</span>: "YES! Everything! My house, my car, my business ‚Äì I want it ALL tokenized! I'll be the richest man in Web3!"
            </div>
            <p>Dionysus DAO shrugged. "Your wish is granted. Good luck."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="chapter">
            <div class="chapter-title">üí∞ PART TWO: The Golden Touch</div>
            <p>At first, it was INCREDIBLE.</p>
            <p>Midas touched his desk ‚Äì BOOM, it became $DESK tokens.</p>
            <p>He touched his car ‚Äì BOOM, $TESLA tokens.</p>
            <p>He touched his office building ‚Äì BOOM, $REALESTATE tokens.</p>

                <span class="character">Midas</span>: "Dangerous? I just 10x'd our net worth! I'm a GENIUS!"
            </div>
            <p>He kept touching things. His furniture. His artwork. His wine collection. Everything became tokens.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="chapter">
            <div class="chapter-title">üò∞ PART THREE: The Problem</div>
            <p>Then Midas got hungry. He tried to eat a sandwich.</p>
            <p>The moment he touched it ‚Äì BOOM. $SANDWICH tokens.</p>
            <div class="dialogue">
                <span class="character">Midas</span>: "Uh... I can't eat tokens."<br><br>

                <span class="character">His Stomach</span>: "Can you eat money?"
            </div>
            <p>He tried to drink water. It became $WATER tokens.</p>
            <p>He tried to put on a jacket. It became $JACKET tokens.</p>
            <p>He tried to pet his dog. It became $DOG tokens.</p>
            <div class="dialogue">
                <span class="character">Midas</span> (panicking): "WAIT NO! NOT THE DOG! REVERSE! REVERSE!"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Blockchain</span>: "Transaction confirmed. $DOG tokens minted. This cannot be reversed."<br><br>

                <span class="character">Blockchain</span>: "Yes. And now it's 10,000 $DOG tokens trading at $0.001 each. Congratulations on your liquidity."

        </div>

        <div class="chapter">
            <div class="chapter-title">üíî PART FOUR: The Curse</div>
            <p>Midas's daughter ran up to hug him. He tried to push her away, but it was too late.</p>
            <p>The moment they touched ‚Äì BOOM. $DAUGHTER tokens.</p>
            <div class="dialogue">
                <span class="character">Midas</span> (screaming): "NOOOOO! NOT HER! PLEASE!"<br><br>

                <span class="character">Midas</span>: "I... I didn't mean to... I just wanted wealth..."<br><br>
                <span class="character">His Wife</span>: "Our daughter is now a CRYPTOCURRENCY?!"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Blockchain</span>: "Minting 1,000,000 $DAUGHTER tokens. Would you like to provide liquidity on UniSwap?"
            </div>
            <p>Midas looked at his portfolio:</p>
            <div class="portfolio">

                <p>Ability to Physically Touch Anything: 0</p>

            <p>He was the richest man in crypto... and the most miserable.</p>

        <div class="chapter">
            <div class="chapter-title">üìâ PART FIVE: The Market Crash</div>
            <p>Then the inevitable happened. A whale dumped their $REALESTATE tokens. The market panicked.</p>
            <div class="crash">
                <p>üö® MARKET CRASH ALERT üö®</p>

                <p>$DAUGHTER: DELISTED (RUG PULL SUSPECTED)</p>
                <p><br>TOTAL VALUE: $6.4 MILLION üìâ</p>
                <p>Was: $500M / Now: $6.4M</p>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <span class="character">Midas</span>: "This... this can't be happening..."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Crypto Twitter</span>: "$DAUGHTER was a scam coin! Founder minted tokens of his own daughter! SELL EVERYTHING!"<br><br>

                <span class="character">Crypto Twitter</span>: "That's what they all say! RUGPULL!"
            </div>
            <p>Midas couldn't eat (food became tokens). Couldn't drink (water became tokens). Couldn't hug anyone (they'd become tokens). And now his tokens were worthless.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="chapter">
            <div class="chapter-title">üôè PART SIX: The Reversal</div>
            <p>Midas returned to Dionysus DAO, broken and desperate.</p>
            <div class="dialogue">
                <span class="character">Midas</span>: "Please... undo this curse. I'll give up everything. I just want my family back. My dog. My normal life."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Dionysus DAO</span>: "We warned you to think carefully."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Midas</span>: "I know! I was wrong! Not everything should be tokenized! Some things need to be REAL! Physical! Human!"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Dionysus DAO</span>: "Say it louder for the people in the back."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Midas</span>: "NOT EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE ON THE BLOCKCHAIN!"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Dionysus DAO</span>: "Good. We'll reverse it. But you'll lose all your tokens."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Midas</span>: "I don't CARE about the tokens! I want my daughter back!"
            </div>
            <p>They reversed the curse. Everything returned to normal. His daughter hugged him (for real, not as a token). His dog licked his face. He ate a sandwich and it tasted like HEAVEN.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="chapter">
            <div class="chapter-title">üìö PART SEVEN: The Lesson</div>
            <p>One year later, Midas spoke at the same crypto conference.</p>
            <div class="dialogue">
                <span class="character">Midas</span> (on stage): "I tokenized everything in my life. My possessions. My business. My dog. My daughter. And you know what I learned?"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Audience</span>: *uncomfortable silence*<br><br>
                <span class="character">Midas</span>: "Not everything SHOULD be a token. Some things have value BECAUSE they're real, physical, human, and unreproducible."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Audience Member</span>: "But blockchain increases liquidity!"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Midas</span>: "Do you want your DAUGHTER to have liquidity?!"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Audience Member</span>: "...no."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Midas</span>: "EXACTLY. Not everything needs to be traded. Not everything needs to be financialized. Not everything needs to be on-chain."
            </div>
            <p>He continued: "Crypto has uses. I'm not anti-crypto. But when your FIRST instinct is 'how do I tokenize this?' you've lost the plot. My dog didn't need to be an NFT. My daughter didn't need to be a coin. My sandwich definitely didn't need to be on the blockchain."</p>
            <p>"The ancient Greeks told the story of King Midas to warn against greed. He wished for the golden touch and lost everything he loved. I wished for the crypto touch and learned the same lesson, 2,800 years later."</p>
            <p>"Some value can't be tokenized. Some wealth can't be quantified. And some things are priceless BECAUSE they're not for sale."</p>
