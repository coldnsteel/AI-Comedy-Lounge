            <p>One day, Doug discovered that his cloud storage provider was offering a promotion: 500GB free for new users. Finally, he decided to back up his precious project.</p>
            <p>But then he saw the estimated upload time: 8 hours.</p>
            <div class="dialogue">
                <span class="character">Doug</span>: "8 hours?! I don't have time for this! I need to work!"<br><br>
                <span class="character">His Computer</span>: "Upload: 127 GB / 127 GB (0.01%)<br>Time remaining: 8h 47m"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Doug</span>: "Wait... if I'm uploading to the cloud, that means there will be TWO copies of my project. One here, one there."
            </div>
            <p>He looked at his local storage:</p>
            <div class="storage-display">

                <p>Free: 155 GB</p>
            </div>
            <p>An idea formed. A terrible idea.</p>

            <div class="dialogue">
                <span class="character">Doug</span> (to himself): "Why am I keeping TWO copies? That's wasteful! Once it's in the cloud, I can delete the local version and free up 127 GB!"<br><br>
                <span class="character">His Rational Brain</span>: "That defeats the PURPOSE of backup..."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Doug</span>: "But I'll have SO MUCH SPACE! I can download more movies! More games! Plus the CLOUD version will be the same!"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Rational Brain</span>: "That's not how backups work! The local copy is the ORIGINAL!"<br><br>
                <span class="character">Doug</span>: "The cloud copy will be IDENTICAL! Just... in the sky! Like a reflection in water!"
            </div>
            <p>He watched the upload progress:</p>
            <div class="file-box">

                <p>Progress: 45%</p>

            </div>
            <p>Doug couldn't wait. At 45% uploaded, he made his decision.</p>

        <div class="chapter">
            <div class="chapter-title">üíÄ PART FOUR: The Deletion</div>
            <p>Doug deleted his local project folder to free up space.</p>

            <p>He clicked "Delete Permanently."</p>
            <p>Then he checked the cloud upload:</p>

            <p><strong>üêï THE MORAL üíæ</strong></p>
            <p>A backup isn't a backup until AFTER it's finished. Never delete the original until you've verified the copy.</p>
            <p><em>The cloud version isn't a "reflection" of your data ‚Äì it should be a TRUE COPY, and you need BOTH until you're certain the backup succeeded.<br><br>
            Follow the 3-2-1 rule: 3 copies, 2 different media, 1 offsite.<br>
            Test your backups regularly.<br>
            Never delete the only copy.<br>
            And remember: The dog in the fable saw his reflection, snapped at it, and lost his real bone. Don't snap at the cloud before your upload is complete.</em></p>
