            <p>Once upon a time (specifically, 2025 AD), there was a programmer named Dale who worked at a company called DateTimeIO. They made calendar and scheduling software used by millions.</p>
            <p>Dale was proud of his progressive values. One day, he decided to make the codebase more "inclusive" by removing all references to AD/BC.</p>
            <div class="dialogue">

            <div class="chapter-title">üîß PART TWO: The Great Refactoring</div>
            <p>Dale spent three weeks refactoring the entire codebase:</p>

            <div class="chapter-title">üìÖ PART THREE: The Pascha Problem</div>
            <p>Everything seemed fine until Easter (Pascha) season arrived. A Christian client called with a feature request:</p>
            <div class="dialogue">
                <span class="character">Client</span>: "We need your software to calculate the date of Pascha for the next 50 years."<br><br>

                <span class="character">Client</span>: "Great! By the way, we use the traditional calculation based on the spring equinox and the full moon, as established at the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Dale</span>: "You mean 325... CE."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Client</span>: "No, AD. Anno Domini. The council happened 325 years after Christ's birth."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Dale</span>: "We don't use that terminology. We say CE."<br><br>
                <span class="character">Client</span>: "But Pascha is ABOUT Christ's resurrection. The entire holiday is calculated FROM His death and resurrection! How can you calculate Easter without referencing what it's commemorating?"

                <p>"I tried to make our calendar system more 'neutral' by replacing AD with CE. What I learned:</p>
                <p>1. <strong>CE and AD are the same years</strong>. We didn't change the zero point, just the label.</p>
                <p>2. <strong>'Common Era' is MORE confusing</strong>, not less. What's common about it? That we all use the Christian calendar? That's not neutral ‚Äì that's just hiding the origin.</p>
                <p>3. <strong>You need a reference point to navigate</strong>. Greenwich for longitude. ISO standards for computing. Anno Domini for years. Removing the name doesn't remove the reference ‚Äì it just makes it unclear.</p>
                <p>4. <strong>Acknowledging history isn't endorsing it</strong>. I can use AD without being Christian, just like I can use Arabic numerals without being Muslim or use a Roman calendar without worshiping Jupiter.</p>
                <p>5. <strong>Sometimes 'neutrality' is just historical amnesia</strong>. We wanted to be inclusive by erasing the origin of our dating system. But that didn't make it neutral ‚Äì it made it nonsensical.</p>
                <p>I couldn't calculate Pascha (Easter) without acknowledging WHY we count years the way we do. The algorithm requires knowing what event established the counting. Hiding that didn't make the math work better ‚Äì it made it impossible.</p>
                <p>So I'm reverting to AD/BC. Not because I'm Christian (I'm not), but because it's HONEST about what we're counting from. You can't navigate when you pretend the anchor doesn't exist."</p>

            <p>This fable isn't anti-secular. It's pro-clarity. We can respect all traditions while acknowledging that our shared Western calendar has a specific origin point: the (approximate) birth of Christ. Calling it "Common Era" doesn't change that ‚Äì it just obscures it. And you can't calculate Easter without knowing what Easter commemorates.</p>
