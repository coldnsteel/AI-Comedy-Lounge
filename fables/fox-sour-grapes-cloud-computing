        <div class="narrator-intro">
            <strong>NARRATOR:</strong> Today's story is about Fred the Fox, who's about to teach us an important lesson about how NOT to handle rejection. Spoiler alert: He handles it exactly how you'd expect from someone who describes themselves as a "thought leader" on LinkedIn.
        </div>
        
        <div class="fable-text">
            Once upon a time in a mid-sized startup (the kind with a ping-pong table nobody uses and free LaCroix), there worked a <span class="character-fox">Fox</span> named Fred. Fred was a senior developer who'd been with the company since the early days, back when they operated out of someone's garage and paid in equity promises.
        </div>

        <div class="narrator-aside">
            <strong>NARRATOR'S NOTE:</strong> Those equity promises? Still haven't vested. But we're getting ahead of ourselves...
        </div>
        
        <div class="fable-text">
            One day, Fred heard that the company was migrating to AWS. The entire infrastructure! Everything moving to the cloud! And best of all‚Äîthey were looking for someone to lead the migration project. AWS certification! Conference talks! The respect of his peers! Maybe even a LinkedIn "Top Voice" badge!
        </div>

        <div class="pun-alert">
            Fred's ambitions were reaching... CLOUD nine! ü•Å
        </div>
        
        <div class="fable-text">
            Fred immediately applied for the position. He spent hours crafting his application, name-dropping every tech buzzword he could think of: "Synergistic cloud-native paradigm shift leveraging agile DevOps to disrupt the blockchain of things."
        </div>

        <div class="narrator-aside">
            <strong>NARRATOR:</strong> That sentence hurt to type. We apologize to the English language.
        </div>

        <div class="fable-text">
            But when the company announced the lead for the cloud migration, it wasn't Fred. It was Carla the Crow, a junior developer who'd only been there six months but actually had, you know, AWS certification and relevant experience.
        </div>

        <div class="rejection-email">
            <strong>Subject: Cloud Migration Lead Position - Application Update</strong><br><br>
            Dear Fred,<br><br>
            Thank you for your interest in the Cloud Migration Lead position. After careful consideration, we've decided to move forward with another candidate who more closely matches our requirements (specifically: actual cloud computing experience).<br><br>
            We encourage you to apply for future opportunities!<br><br>
            Best regards,<br>

        <div class="fable-text">
            Fred's tail drooped. His ears flattened. His pride... well, his pride decided to throw a tantrum instead of handling this like a mature professional.

        <div class="narrator-aside">
            <strong>NARRATOR:</strong> This is where things get ugly, folks. You might want to buckle up.
        </div>

        <div class="fable-text">
            Within five minutes, Fred had posted on every tech forum, Slack channel, and social media platform he could find:

                Honestly, I didn't want that cloud migration project anyway. Cloud computing is overrated. Everyone's rushing to AWS just because it's trendy, but on-premises servers are MORE reliable, MORE secure, and MORE cost-effective. üôÑ<br><br>
                Plus, "the cloud" is just someone else's computer. Wake up, sheeple! I'm perfectly happy staying in my lane with REAL infrastructure.<br><br>

            But Fred wasn't done! Oh no. Over the next week, he:

        <div class="fable-text" style="text-indent: 0; padding-left: 40px;">
            ‚Ä¢ Wrote a Medium article titled "Why AWS is Actually Bad and You're All Wrong"<br>

        </div>

        <div class="fable-text">
            Meanwhile, Carla the Crow was successfully leading the migration. Servers hummed in their cloud environments. Costs went down. Scalability went up. Everything worked beautifully.
        </div>

        <div class="fable-text">
            One day, the CTO approached Fred with an opportunity: <span class="character-crow">"Hey Fred, now that we're on AWS, we need someone to manage our cloud security. Interested? It comes with AWS training and certification."</span>
        </div>

        <div class="fable-text">
            Fred's ears perked up. His tail wagged. His principles suddenly became... flexible.

        <div class="dialogue">
            <span class="character-fox">FRED:</span> "Well, I mean, I suppose if the company NEEDS me to learn cloud computing, I could make that sacrifice. For the team, you know. Not because I want to or anything."

        <div class="fable-text">
            Fred took the position. Within two weeks, he'd deleted all his anti-cloud posts, changed his LinkedIn headline to "Cloud Security Specialist | AWS Enthusiast," and was posting articles about "Why AWS is Actually Good and I Definitely Always Thought This."
        </div>

        <div class="narrator-aside">
            <strong>NARRATOR:</strong> The internet remembers everything, Fred. Screenshots are forever.
        </div>

        <div class="fable-text">
            But the other developers remembered his rant phase. Every time Fred tried to give cloud computing advice, someone would pipe up: <span class="character-crow">"Wait, aren't you the guy who said the cloud was just 'someone else's computer' and we were all sheep?"</span>
        </div>

        <div class="fable-text">
            Fred learned, too late, that burning bridges and then trying to cross them later leaves you with singed fur and a damaged reputation.
