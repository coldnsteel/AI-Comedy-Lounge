            <p>TechCorp had 200 employees, all happily working in their secure corporate pasture. They had strong firewalls, multi-factor authentication, and regular security training. The IT shepherd, Marcus, kept them safe.</p>

            <p>Wolfgang was a social engineer‚Äîa professional predator. He didn't hack systems; he hacked people. And TechCorp was his next target.</p>
            <p>He spent three weeks researching:</p>
            <ul style="margin: 20px 40px;">
                <li>LinkedIn profiles (who works there?)</li>

                <li>Email formats (firstname.lastname@techcorp.com)</li>

            <p>The domain "techcorp-it.com" looked almost identical to "techcorp.com". Wolfgang registered it for $12.</p>

            <p>He'd found Marcus's emails in a data breach from a third-party vendor. He studied Marcus's writing style, common phrases, even his signature sign-off: "Stay secure, Marcus."</p>
            <p>The wolf had become indistinguishable from the sheep.</p>

                <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Urgent: Password Reset Required Due to Security Patch</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Hi team,</p>
                <p>Our security team just deployed a critical patch to address a zero-day vulnerability discovered this morning. As a precautionary measure, we need everyone to reset their passwords within the next 4 hours.</p>
                <p><strong>Please click here to reset your password:</strong> https://techcorp-portal.com/password-reset</p>
                <p>This is mandatory for all employees. If you don't reset within 4 hours, your account will be temporarily locked and you'll need to contact IT to unlock it (which could take 24-48 hours).</p>
                <p>I know this is inconvenient, but security comes first. Thank you for your cooperation.</p>
                <p>Stay secure,<br>Marcus</p>

                <span class="character">Marcus</span>: "Who sent an email from 'techcorp-it.com'? That's not our domain!"<br><br>
