            <p>Corvina was a junior developer working on a critical feature: implement OAuth2 authentication for her company's API. She'd been stuck for two days.</p>
            <p>The problem was like a pitcher of water just out of reach‚Äîshe could SEE the solution, but couldn't quite access it.</p>
