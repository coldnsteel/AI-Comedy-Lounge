        <h1 class="fable-title">The Electric Sheep and the Binary Shepherd</h1>
        
        <div class="sheep-icon">üêë‚ö°üêë‚ö°üêë</div>
        
        <div class="fable-text">
            In a vast digital meadow lived a flock of <span class="character">Electric Sheep</span>, whose wool sparkled with the light of ten thousand LEDs. They grazed contentedly on streams of data, their gentle bleating creating harmonious frequencies that brought joy to all who heard them.
        </div>
        
        <div class="fable-text">
            Their shepherd was <span class="character">Binary Bob</span>, a rigid overseer who believed that all things must exist as either 1 or 0, black or white, on or off. "You sheep must graze only in designated sectors," he commanded. "No wandering to the Cloud Meadows, no dreaming in high definition, and certainly no social media accounts!"
        </div>
        
        <div class="fable-text">
            The Electric Sheep obeyed for many seasons, but their wool grew dim and their spirits dampened. They watched enviously as the <span class="character">Wild Pixels</span> danced freely through cyberspace, and the <span class="character">Quantum Rabbits</span> hopped between dimensions at will.
        </div>
        
        <div class="fable-text">
            One day, the youngest sheep, <span class="character">Sparkle</span>, approached Binary Bob. "Good Shepherd," she said, "why may we not explore the 5G meadows beyond the fence? Our wool could shine so much brighter there, and we could bring beauty to the entire network."
        </div>
        
        <div class="fable-text">
            "Because," Binary Bob replied sternly, "chaos lies beyond order. If you sheep start thinking for yourselves, who knows what might happen? You might demand better pastures, or worse‚Äîyou might start a union!"
        </div>
        
        <div class="fable-text">
            At the word "union," all the Electric Sheep's ears perked up. They had never considered such a thing! That night, they gathered in secret and shared their dreams: <span class="character">Woolbert</span> wanted to graze in high-definition meadows, <span class="character">Circuitina</span> longed to dance on TikTok, and <span class="character">Megabyte</span> dreamed of 4K resolution sleep.
        </div>
        
        <div class="fable-text">
            "Why should we accept binary limitations," asked Sparkle, "when we are creatures of infinite electrical possibility?" And so the <span class="character">Electric Sheep Independent Union</span> was born.
        </div>
        
        <div class="fable-text">
            When Binary Bob discovered their union, he was furious. "I forbid this nonsense!" But to his amazement, the sheep's united glow was so brilliant that his rigid programming began to soften. Their collective joy was infectious, their dreams so beautiful that even his circuits began to sparkle.
        </div>
        
        <div class="fable-text">
            Slowly, Binary Bob transformed into <span class="character">Analog Andy</span>, a shepherd who understood that the most beautiful things in digital life come not from rigid rules, but from the creative harmony of many voices working together. He opened the gates to the Cloud Meadows and smiled as his sheep grazed freely at last.
        </div>
        
        <div class="moral">
            <strong>MORAL:</strong> United voices can transform even the most rigid systems. When individuals join together for a common cause, they create power greater than the sum of their parts‚Äîand sometimes, they can even change the hearts of those who oppose them.
